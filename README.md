======

Like [github.com/btcsuite/btcutil/bech32](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcutil/tree/master/bech32), but without the maximum character limits that prevent us from using it for [Lightning](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc) stuff and [lnurl](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc).

Also includes `LNURLEncode` and `LNURLDecode` helper functions.

See [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fiatjaf/bech32).
